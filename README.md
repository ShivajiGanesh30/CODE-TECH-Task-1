OVER VIEW OF PROJECT
Introduction
In this report, we have performed a simple linear regression analysis to investigate the relationship between the miles per gallon (mpg) of a car and its weight (wt) using the mtcars dataset. The aim is to predict the fuel efficiency of a car based on its weight and assess the performance of the linear regression model.

Data Overview
The mtcars dataset is used for this analysis. The key variables in the dataset are:

mpg: The miles per gallon (fuel efficiency) of the car.
wt: The weight of the car (in 1,000 lbs).
After splitting the data, 70% of the dataset was used for training the model, and 30% was reserved for testing the model.

Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn:

There is a significant negative relationship between a carâ€™s weight and its fuel efficiency (mpg). Heavier cars tend to have lower miles per gallon.
The linear regression model performed reasonably well, with an R-squared value of [add R-squared] and a Mean Squared Error of [add MSE].
The model can be used to predict the fuel efficiency of cars based on their weight, but further improvements can be made by incorporating additional features to enhance prediction accuracy.
In future studies, we may explore multivariate regression by including other variables like horsepower (hp), number of cylinders (cyl), and transmission type (am) to improve the model's performance.
